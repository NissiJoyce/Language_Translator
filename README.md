# Application:
This AI-powered language translator allows users to input text, choose a source language, and select a target language to instantly receive accurate translations. Built inside a Jupyter Notebook, it’s a simple yet powerful tool designed for ease of use. The application supports real-time translation and can be used for learning new languages, understanding foreign text, or helping with communication across cultures. Whether you’re a student, traveler, teacher, or multilingual enthusiast, this translator makes cross-language interaction seamless and efficient.

 # Technologies Used

  Python:
    The backbone of the application—used for logic, GUI development, and integration of APIs.

  Tkinter:
    Python’s standard GUI library, used to design a simple and user-friendly desktop interface for text input, language selection, and displaying results.

  Googletrans (Google Translate API wrapper):
    Handles the core translation functionality by interfacing with Google Translate. It supports dozens of languages with fast and accurate translations.

  gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):
    Converts the translated text into speech, adding an auditory component to your application. Great for language learners or visually impaired users.

  Playsound:
    A lightweight library used to play the speech audio files generated by gTTS.

  ttk (Themed Tkinter Widgets):
    An extension of Tkinter used for modern-looking UI components like combo boxes (dropdowns), making the interface more polished and user-friendly.
